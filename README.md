# LEAD SCORING CASE STUDY
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

## General Information
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.



## Conclusions
•⁠  . X Education has a period of 2 months every year during which they hire some interns. The sales 
team, in particular, has around 10 interns allotted to them. So during this phase, they wish to make 
the lead conversion more aggressive. So they want almost all of the potential leads (i.e. the 
customers who have been predicted as 1 by the model) to be converted and hence, want to make 
phone calls to as much of such people as possible. Suggest a good strategy they should employ 
at this stage.
•⁠  Similarly, at times, the company reaches its target for a quarter before the deadline. During this 
time, the company wants the sales team to focus on some new work as well. So during this time, 
the company’s aim is to not make phone calls unless it’s extremely necessary, i.e. they want to 
minimize the rate of useless phone calls. Suggest a strategy they should employ at this stage.
